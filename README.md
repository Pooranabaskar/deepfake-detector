Deepfake Detection System using Deep Learning
This project is a Deepfake Detection System built using Deep Learning techniques and hosted via a Flask web application. It allows users to upload images or videos and uses a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify them as real or fake (deepfake). This tool is aimed at enhancing digital media authenticity verification in the fight against misinformation.

🔍 Features
Upload and analyze images or videos

Detect whether the media is real or deepfake

Real-time prediction with user-friendly interface

Flask-based web server for easy deployment

Deep Learning model trained on datasets like FF++ or custom datasets

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

Flask – Web framework

TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch – For building and training the model

OpenCV – For video and image processing

NumPy / Pandas – Data handling and preprocessing

HTML / CSS / JS – Frontend interface

📊 Model Training (Optional)
If you'd like to train your own model:

Prepare dataset (e.g., FF++ dataset or others)

Use train_model.py (not included in base repo, add if needed)

Save the model in the model/ directory

📌 Future Improvements
Add support for deepfake video detection using frame analysis

Improve model accuracy with latest datasets

Add REST API endpoints for remote analysis

Deploy to cloud (Heroku, AWS, etc.)
